Movie Website : a vibrant, completely responsive web application that examines interesting TV series and films. It is made with React, Axios, Redux, and Custom Hooks and retrieves data from the TMDB API in real time. With the aid of several helpful React modules, it provides an immersive experience.

Features to pay attention to are as follows:

->whenever you click on any movie, all the information is retrieved from the API and displayed, including cast, actor, movie rating, genre, and so on.
->Below that, you will also find a section where you can watch trailers for related YouTube videos, and I've also included a section where you can watch recommendations for movies based on what you've clicked
->Another thing to note is that, in the event that I have no data, my loading skeleton will be displayed on the screen. At some point when I'll scroll up and down on the basis of that , my header will simply move away and return when I scroll up.Even though it's a minor detail, I've taken notice of it to make it worthy of a webpage.
